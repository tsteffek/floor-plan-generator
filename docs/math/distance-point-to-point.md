# distancePointToPoint

`fun distancePointToPoint(a: `[`Point`](../model.geometry/-point/index.md)`, b: `[`Point`](../model.geometry/-point/index.md)`): `[`Double`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-double/index.html)

Calculates the distance between two [Point](../model.geometry/-point/index.md)s [a](distance-point-to-point.md#math$distancePointToPoint(model.geometry.Point, model.geometry.Point)/a) and [b](distance-point-to-point.md#math$distancePointToPoint(model.geometry.Point, model.geometry.Point)/b).
