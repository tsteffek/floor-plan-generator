# fromTwoPoints

`fun fromTwoPoints(a: `[`Point`](../-point/index.md)`, b: `[`Point`](../-point/index.md)`): `[`Line`](index.md)

Computes the line between two [Point](../-point/index.md)s [a](from-two-points.md#model.geometry.Line.Companion$fromTwoPoints(model.geometry.Point, model.geometry.Point)/a) and [b](from-two-points.md#model.geometry.Line.Companion$fromTwoPoints(model.geometry.Point, model.geometry.Point)/b).
